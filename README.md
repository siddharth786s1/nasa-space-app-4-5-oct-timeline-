# NASA Space Apps Challenge Timeline

This repository contains a project that provides a detailed timeline for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, a 36-hour global hackathon. The project includes a web page that visually represents the schedule and key phases of the event.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The main feature of this project is the `nasa.html` file, which presents a comprehensive guide to the hackathon's 36-hour journey. It is designed to help participants understand the event's flow, from the opening ceremony to the final project submissions and awards.

## ✨ Features

*   **Detailed Event Timeline:** A step-by-step schedule for both days of the hackathon (Saturday and Sunday).
*   **Project Phases Chart:** A doughnut chart that visualizes the typical time allocation for different stages of a project during the hackathon (Ideation, Development, Finalizing, and Pitching).
*   **Responsive Design:** The webpage is designed to be accessible and readable on various devices, including desktops and mobile phones.
*   **PDF Version:** A PDF version of the timeline (`htm45l.pdf`) is also included in the repository.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** The core structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the user interface.
*   **Chart.js:** A JavaScript library used to create the interactive doughnut chart for project phases.
